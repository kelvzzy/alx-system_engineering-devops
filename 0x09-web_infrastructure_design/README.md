1 domain name www.foobar.com configured with a www record that points to server 8.8.8.8
1-distributed_web_infrastructure - Add the following:

2 servers
1 web server (Nginx)
1 application server
1 application files (code base)
1 MySQL database
2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure - Add the following:

3 firewalls
1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS
3 monitoring clients
3-scale_up - Add the following:
